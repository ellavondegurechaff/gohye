# Effect System Revamp - Final Implementation Plan (Challenging Version)

## Core Philosophy
Transform effects from static purchases into a challenging progression system with tiered upgrades, similar to card leveling difficulty curve, while maintaining clean architecture.

## Key Features

### 1. **Tiered Progression (1-5 Stars)**
- Each effect has 5 tiers with increasing benefits
- Progress through natural gameplay actions

- **Exponential difficulty curve** - Higher tiers require significantly more effort

### 2. **Smart Progress Tracking**
- Automatically tracks relevant actions
- No manual tracking needed
- Progress integrated into existing commands
- **No bonus multipliers** - Pure grind, just like Hyejoo tradition

### 3. **Interactive Elements**

#### Effect Activation Feedback
When effects trigger, show engaging messages:
```
🍰 Cake Day activated! +45 flakes (Tier 3)
[████████░░] 750/2500 claims to Tier 4!
```

#### Milestone Celebrations
At 25%, 50%, 75% progress:
```

Keep claiming to unlock +70 flakes per daily!
```

```

### 8. **Commands**
