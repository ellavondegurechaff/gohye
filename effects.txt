the new effect system doesnt rely on one single tier of an effect. You can upgrade your passive effects to make them stronger and manage them based on your own focus. 
Since lemons are gone now you wont have to buy additional slots, you can equip all passive effects without buying extra slots.
The new system doesnt use "passive effects" and "active effects" anymore, it refers to them as "effects" and "items".
in the shop you have 2 different categories for them ("effects" and "items")

with /effects you can see all the effects you currently have equipped as well as their tier and your progress on the requirement to upgrade.
with /effect info "effect:" you can see what the selected effect does and what upgrading their tier will do.
with /effect upgrade "effect:" you can upgrade the selected effect to its next tier.

In order to upgrade an effect you need to fulfill certain requirements based on the effect. The requirement will have something to do with what the effect does. After certain thresholds you can use /effect upgrade to increase the tier of your effect. Each effect has 5 different tiers.

Items can be viewed in your inventory under the category "items", it shows the item name as well as if the item is ready to be used or if it is on cooldown. It also shows how many uses you have left.
You can not purchase items directly. When buying an item, you receive a recipe for it. In order to gain the item you have to collect all cards listed in the recipe.
Use /item use "item:" "extra_argument:" to consume one use of the item.

additional idea for wider usage of vials:
extra shop page for card boosters

You can use vials to purchase card booster packs that contain 5 cards
there are 3 different booster packs in the shop, they reset every 24 hours
every user can buy 1 of each, then the booster slot is empty for them
