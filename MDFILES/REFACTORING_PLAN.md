# GoHYE Sequential Refactoring Plan

*Comprehensive refactoring plan with sequential execution flow using subagents*

## Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDATION: REFACTOR (NOT REWRITE)**

Based on comprehensive analysis, GoHYE has solid architectural foundations with repository patterns, working economic systems, and stable Discord integration. The issues are duplication and coupling, not fundamental design flaws. Refactoring will deliver 80% of benefits with 20% of the risk compared to rewriting.

## Agent Instructions & Constraints

### Mandatory Agent Behavior
```yaml
Before ANY Implementation:
  1. GREP existing codebase for similar functionality
  2. ENTER PLAN MODE to design changes
  3. DOCUMENT current behavior before modifying
  4. VERIFY no breaking changes to existing interfaces

During Implementation:
  1. Use Context7 MCP for disgo framework documentation
  2. Preserve ALL existing functionality
  3. Test changes through Discord interactions
  4. Maintain backwards compatibility

After Implementation:
  1. VERIFY existing tests still pass (Discord interactions)
  2. DOCUMENT any interface changes
  3. CONFIRM no regressions in functionality
```

### Strict Engineering Constraints
```yaml
DO NOT:
  - Change existing Discord command interfaces
  - Modify database schemas
  - Break existing component handlers
  - Change economic calculation results
  - Alter user-facing behavior
  - Over-engineer solutions

DO:
  - Preserve exact existing behavior
  - Use existing patterns and conventions
  - Maintain database transaction integrity
  - Keep Discord framework integration unchanged
  - Test thoroughly via Discord interactions
```

### Context7 MCP Usage
```yaml
When Working With Discord Framework:
  - Use Context7 to lookup disgo documentation
  - Verify handler patterns match framework expectations
  - Confirm component interaction patterns
  - Check event handling best practices
  - Validate embed and response formats
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Economic System Changes** - Core business logic that affects user gameplay
2. **Database Operations** - Transaction patterns and repository modifications
3. **Discord Integration** - Command handlers and component interactions

### Mitigation Approach
1. **Incremental Changes** - One component at a time
2. **Comprehensive Testing** - Test each change via Discord interactions
3. **Rollback Plan** - Keep original implementations until proven stable
4. **Documentation** - Document all changes and interface modifications

### Success Criteria
```yaml
Phase Completion Requirements:
  - All existing Discord commands work identically
  - Economic operations produce same results
  - Database integrity maintained
  - No regressions in user functionality
  - Code duplication reduced as planned
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Quantified Improvements
- **Code Reduction**: 500-700 lines of duplicate code eliminated
- **Coupling Reduction**: Economic system dependencies reduced from 5+ to 1-2
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for common operations
- **Consistency**: Standardized patterns across all commands

### Quality Improvements
- **Testability**: Extracted services can be unit tested
- **Debugging**: Centralized error handling improves debugging
- **Development Speed**: Reusable components accelerate feature development
- **Code Quality**: Reduced complexity and improved organization
