## Agent Instructions & Safety Protocols

### Mandatory Agent Behavior
```yaml
Before ANY Implementation:
  1. GREP existing codebase for patterns and dependencies
  2. ENTER PLAN MODE to design changes thoroughly
  3. DOCUMENT current behavior with specific examples
  4. VERIFY no breaking changes to existing interfaces
  5. CREATE rollback plan for changes

During Implementation:
  1. Use Context7 MCP for Go framework documentation when needed
  2. PRESERVE ALL existing functionality exactly
  3. TEST changes through Discord interactions when possible
  4. MAINTAIN backwards compatibility with all interfaces
  5. MONITOR performance impact of changes

After Implementation:
  1. VERIFY existing functionality still works correctly
  2. DOCUMENT any interface changes or new patterns
  3. CONFIRM no regressions in performance or behavior
  4. UPDATE relevant documentation files
```

### Critical Safety Constraints
```yaml
NEVER:
  - Change Discord command interfaces or responses
  - Modify database schemas without migration scripts
  - Break existing component handlers or interactions
  - Alter economic calculation results or user-facing behavior
  - Change configuration file formats without backward compatibility
  - Remove existing functionality even if it seems unused

ALWAYS:
  - Preserve exact existing behavior and output
  - Use existing code patterns and conventions
  - Maintain database transaction integrity
  - Keep Discord framework integration unchanged
  - Test thoroughly via Discord interactions when possible
  - Create comprehensive rollback procedures
```

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
