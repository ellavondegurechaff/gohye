for the quest system Id keep it traditional and similar to the current one, just more polished and engaging.

you get 3 daily quests, 3 weekly quests and 3 monthly quests. you will get 1 tier 1, 1 tier 2 and 1 tier 3 quest each.
for a more engaging experience Id give them all names and change the system so the quests dont auto-complete themselves.

With /quests you can scroll through your daily, weekly and monthly quests (3 pages each showing one category).
If a quest is complete there will be a check-mark in front of it and the text will be green, uncompleteted quests will just have a normal color.

if you want to get your rewards you can /questclaim to get your rewards.
this command will display
> You completed:
> x daily quests
> x weekly quests
> x monthly quests
> As a reward you gain x .
Once a quest has been claimed, /quests will not show it anymore. /questclaim will only show the lines that are affected (for example if you only completed 1 daily quest, the weekly quests and monthly quests line wont pop up)

For the quests themselves Id use 5 different ones per tier so we have a good amount of rotation.
